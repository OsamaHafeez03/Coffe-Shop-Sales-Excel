# â˜• Coffee Shop Sales Performance Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of six months of sales data from a multi-location coffee shop. The goal was to transform raw transaction data into actionable business intelligence using Microsoft Excel to identify key performance indicators (KPIs), understand sales trends, and optimize operations.

## Key Objectives
Analyze Revenue Trends: Track month-over-month revenue performance and overall growth.

Identify Top Performers: Determine the best-selling products and product categories by revenue and transaction volume.

Optimize Operations: Pinpoint peak transaction times by day of the week and hour of the day to inform staffing and inventory decisions.

Create an Interactive Dashboard: Consolidate key findings into a clear, single-page executive dashboard for quick decision-making.

## Tools and Techniques
The entire analysis, from data preparation to visualization, was completed using Microsoft Excel.

## Key Techniques Used
Data Preparation: Handled initial data loading, cleaning, and creating calculated fields (e.g., Revenue, Month Name, Day of Week Name, and Hours for time-based analysis).

Pivot Tables: Leveraged Pivot Tables extensively to aggregate sales data for all key metrics, including:

Monthly Revenue totals.

Total transactions by Day of the Week and Hour.

Top 15 Products by Revenue.

Data Visualization: Created a dynamic dashboard using a variety of charts:

Line chart for Monthly Revenue Trend.

Bar charts for Product Category and Store Performance.

Donut charts and Slicers for Interactive Filtering.

Dashboard Design: Applied principles of data visualization to ensure the dashboard is clutter-free, easy to interpret, and highlights the most important KPIs.

## Key Analytical Insights
The analysis provided several critical insights for the business:

Strong Sales Growth: Total revenue for the six-month period was over $230,000, with a significant peak in sales volume during the transition from Spring to Summer (May and June).

Product Priority: The Coffee category generated the highest revenue, followed by Tea and Food. The single top-performing product by revenue was the Barista Espresso.

Operational Peak: The coffee shop experiences its highest transaction volume on Mondays, and the daily peak hour is consistently 10:00 AM. This suggests a strong weekday morning commuter rush, which is crucial for staffing and preparation.

## Dashboard Preview
The final deliverable is an interactive dashboard built in Excel, allowing users to filter data by store location and product category to explore performance metrics.
